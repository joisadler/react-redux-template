# react-redux-template

## About this project
This is the very simple template based on create-react-app. I created it for those situations when you need to quickly start a simple React project and you don't have time to set up its structure, linters, sass support and all that kind of stuff. For example, when you need to complete a technical challenge in a job interview and your time is limited to a couple of hours.

This project was created primarily for my own use. Of course, you can use it for your own purposes if you want, but remember that **you do it at your own risk**!

## What's included in this template

- `create-react-app` skeleton.
- `scss` support (based on `CSS Modules`).
- redux for state management with simple reducer for some entities.
- basic routing (home page, entities page, single entity page).
- filter entities by name or sort by date.
- Configured `eslint`, `prettier`, and `stylelint`.
- `prop-types`.
- Some useful mixins and utils.
